      <h3>The Arbiter</h3>
      <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/Arbiter" target="_blank"class="social-nw">here</a>

      <div class="bio-copy">

      <p>The establishment of the Covenant led to the <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/Sangheili" target="_blank">Sangheili</a> losing most of their traditions and history. However, the title of Arbiter was maintained as a position of power for the Sangheili.[7] The appellation of Arbiter was bestowed upon the commander-in-chief of the Covenant military, and was regarded as a great privilege among the Sangheili race. Arbiter was a noble title only given to a Sangheili that was considered worthy of bringing justice and peace to the Covenantâ€”some considered it a "badge of greatness". The Arbiter's authority would not be questioned by any other individual in the Covenant.</p>

      <h3>Catherine Elizabeth Halsey</h3>
      <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Catherine_Halsey" target="_blank"class="social-nw">here</a>

      <div class="bio-copy">

      <p>Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, MD, PhD (SN: CC-409871), was a praised scientist and former employee turned prisoner of the Office of Naval Intelligence, best known as the creator of the <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/SPARTAN-II_Program" target="_blank">SPARTAN-II Program</a> and Mjolnir Powered Assault Armor.
      Despite being a civilian, she held considerable authority within ONI and commanded considerable respect from many military figures.[12] As she grew older, Halsey took various extreme measures to protect her remaining Spartans, even going against the military law to do so - a choice which would result in her eventual arrest by ONI's Kilo-Five in 2553. In 2558 when Admiral Osman ordered Catherine's execution, Catherine escaped the assassination attempt and defected to Jul 'Mdama's Covenant.</p>
